### Introduction

Climate Change is happening more than ever. Unfortunately, despite it being a real-threat information about climate change lacks in public. Even if information is available it becomes really hard to seperate propaganda from the truth.

Witnessing this situation and current booming of Large Language Models, we have decided to create an AI that's trained on scientific and authentic knowledge about Climate Change effects, causes, solutions and current political agenda present on it. Further more, helping young and upcoming climate activists to leverage the AI to write articles and slogans for their activism movements and work. 

Our Generative Pretrained Model i.e. **Copper** was trained on data from UN, Canada and other credible sources that described about Climate Change and it's causes and effects. Followed by that, controversial and potential solutions to tackle climate change through Nuclear Energy and carbon zero methods. 

### Technical Background

To leverage outstanding results we used aitextgen's python library to use GPT-2 model to train. But, you can also use GPT-Neo models. Further we have deployed it using Gradio UI library on Huggingface Hub **(Pending)**

Python Libraries used:-
1. aitextgen
2. gradio
3. huggingface-hub

### Notes:

Trained Model can be found in **trained model** folder and datasets can be found likewise in respective folders.
